                <h1>Rocket History</h1>
        
                <p>Rockets have a history dating back to ancient China, but it was in the 20th century that they made significant advances.</p>
                <img class="ladodir imgmeio borda" src="img/fogeutes_evo.jpg" alt="Rocket Evolution Image">
                <p>The Cold War fueled the space race between the USA and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, and in 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth. The USA responded with the Apollo program, which took astronauts to the Moon in 1969.</p>
                <p>If rocket launches are common and frequent today, it's because they are the result of applying principles that were envisioned for the first time over 2,000 years ago. While the concepts behind rocket operation are quite ancient, it was only about 70 years ago that these vehicles began to be used in applications focused on space exploration. But when were rockets invented, and how do they work?</p>

                <h2>Purpose of Rockets</h2>
                <p>The purpose of a rocket is to provide a means of transportation for objects or living beings beyond Earth's atmosphere. Rockets use propulsion by burning fuel to generate an immense amount of thrust, allowing them to overcome gravity and achieve speeds sufficient to reach space.</p>
                <h2>Uses</h2>
                <p>1- Space Exploration: Rockets are launched into orbit and enable space exploration, data collection for advanced studies.</p>
                <p>2- Communications: Communication satellites are launched by rockets and placed in orbit to provide telecommunications services.</p>
                <p>3- Weather Observation and Forecasting: Meteorological satellites launched by rockets are used to monitor Earth's atmosphere, collect climate data, and provide more accurate weather forecasts.</p>
                <p>4- Scientific Research: Rockets are also used to conduct scientific research in various fields.</p>
                <p>5- Military Applications: In certain situations, rockets have military applications, such as launching reconnaissance satellites, ballistic missiles, and rockets for air defense. These applications are directed towards national security and defense purposes.</p>

                <h1>Modeling and Propulsion</h1>
                <h2>Model</h2>
                <p>For our project, we chose the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket as inspiration. We studied its aerodynamics and engineering and redesigned it, making various adaptation changes.</p>
            <img class="imgf" src="img/Falcon_Heavy.webp" alt="">
            <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
            <img class="imgf" src="img/modelo_3d_foguete.png" alt="">
            <p>For its aerodynamics, we chose an ogive nose cone and fins on the sides to reduce air resistance and maintain better stability during launch.</p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The model was designed using SolidWorks software and was divided into 2 parts:</p>
            <ul class="listasmeio">
                <li>Stage 1: Body and Storage Capsule</li>
                <img class="imgf" src="img/estagio1.jpg" alt="">
                <li>Stage 2: Propellers</li>
                <img class="imgf" src="img/estagio2.jpg" alt="">
            </ul>
        
            <h1>Engine/Propeller</h1>
        
            <h2>What is a Rocket Propeller?</h2>
            <p>The rocket's propeller is the part responsible for generating the propulsive force that propels the rocket forward. It is the component of the rocket's propulsion system that produces the necessary thrust to overcome gravity and reach space or accomplish any other desired task.</p>
            <p>The propeller usually consists of one or more rocket engines. These engines are designed to burn fuel and oxidizer, releasing gases at high speed through a nozzle. Expelling the gases backwards generates a reaction that pushes the rocket forward, following Newton's third law of motion, known as the action-reaction principle.</p>
            <p>There are different types of propellers used in rockets, such as solid-fuel propellers, liquid-fuel propellers, and hybrid propellers. Each type has its own characteristics and design requirements.</p>
        
            <h2>Types of Rocket Propellers:</h2>
        
            <p>There are different types of propellers used in rockets, including:</p>
        
            <p>Solid-Fuel Propeller: This type of propeller has fuel and oxidizer mixed into a compact solid. It is often composed of a combination of gunpowder, potassium nitrate, and other ingredients. Solid-fuel propellers are relatively simple to use as they don't require complex feeding systems.</p>
            <p>Liquid-Fuel Propeller: In this type of propeller, the fuel and oxidizer are stored separately in tanks. During combustion, they are injected and mixed in a combustion chamber. Common liquid fuels include kerosene and hydrogen, while the oxidizer is usually liquid oxygen. Liquid-fuel propellers are more complex to handle due to the required feeding and control systems.</p>
            <p>Hybrid Propeller: This is a combination of solid-fuel and liquid-fuel propellers. In this type, one component (usually the fuel) is solid, while the other (oxidizer) is liquid. Combustion occurs when the liquid oxidizer is injected into the solid fuel. Hybrid propellers offer a combination of ease of use and control compared to liquid propellers.</p>
            <p>Water and Compressed Air Propeller: In low-power rockets and school projects, it's also common to use water and compressed air as propellers. The rocket is propelled by the rapid release of pressure generated by the combination of water and compressed air. This approach is safer and more accessible for amateur experiments.</p>
        
            <h2>Propellant Propeller</h2>
            <p>The propellant type chosen for our project is the propellant propeller, which is based on a mixture of solid fuel and oxidizer. We will use a mixture of potassium nitrate (fuel) and refined sugar (oxidizer) that will create a type of mass that, when ignited, releases a high amount of CO2, allowing the rocket to take off and reach altitudes above 50 meters.</p>
        
            <h2>Materials Needed:</h2>
        
            <ul class="listasmeio">
                <li>5 tablespoons of potassium nitrate (KNO3)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of refined sugar</li>

                <li>2 caps with a diameter of 25 mm</li>
                <li>1 tube of instant glue</li>
                <li>1 cylinder with a maximum of 1/3 of the pipe's circumference</li>
                <li>1 frying pan or pot</li>

            </ul>
        
            <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        
            <ul class="listasmeio">
                <li>KNO3 + Sugar in the pan until it becomes a caramel-like substance</li>
                <li>Place the mixture inside the pipe using the cylinder, leaving a hole in the middle</li>
                <li>Seal one end of the pipe with the first cap</li>
